# Self-Orchestrated Multi-Agent System for Collaborative Task Management

## Objective
This project aims to develop a **web-based platform** that orchestrates multiple intelligent agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), to collaboratively perform generative AI tasks. The solution will demonstrate decentralized decision-making and task execution, providing a scalable and interactive system for real-world applications.

## Project Description
Generative AI systems are revolutionizing industries with their ability to process and generate human-like language. This project focuses on integrating LLMs within a **multi-agent framework** to address complex tasks through collaboration. By decomposing high-level goals into sub-tasks, the system leverages specialized agents to execute these tasks dynamically and autonomously.

## Scope of Work
The project will involve:
1. Creating an **LLM-based Task Decomposition Engine** to analyze high-level goals and break them into sub-tasks.
2. Implementing a **Orchestrator** to manage task creation, assignments, and monitoring.
3. Building a **Dynamic Agent System** to execute sub-tasks using LLMs via APIs.
4. Developing an **Event-Driven Workflow Engine** for real-time communication and task orchestration.
5. Designing and developing a **web-based interface** using Node.js and React.js for task input, progress monitoring, and result visualization.

## Deliverables
1. A functional web-based multi-agent orchestration system.
2. Visual representations of agent activity and task workflows.
3. A comprehensive project report detailing system design, implementation, and outcomes.
